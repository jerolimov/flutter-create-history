# Bare project history to compare different flutter versions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jerolimov/flutter-create-history.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jerolimov/flutter-create-history)

This project (will) contain bare [flutter](https://flutter.io/) projects, started just now with flutter 1.0.

It can help you to compare different flutter versions with `git diff` or github compare.
Before upgrade manually you could also try `flutter upgrade` in your project.

Each version is generated with `flutter create tutorial`.
